# Reflection

I've learned a lot from this talk about how to operate a business using an application. There are several steps to take before starting a business. 

Market segmentation is crucial to identify the right group of customers to target. Besides, competitor analysis is essential to understand our distinguishing features and areas for improvement by comparing our service with other companies. The talk also summarized the value propositions of their application, which is the core of their product's competitive advantage. It clearly explains why customers would choose to buy from their company instead of a competitor.

I was impressed by the market strategies used by the I-farm team. It provided useful insights into efficient ways to run a business. This talk also emphasized the potential of technology, which I look forward to applying in my future career to benefit people and the environment. Technology can be applied in various fields, including automation, hospitality, and agriculture.
